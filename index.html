                    <h3>One of the most romantic and inspiring story in the history of mathematics:</h3>
                    <ul>
                    <li>Srinivasa Ramanujan was born on December 22, 1887 in the town of Erode, located in Tamil Nadu. </li>
                    <li>In 1904 Ramanujan left high school, his future looked promising and he had won the school’s mathematics prize and, more importantly, a scholarship allowing him to study at the Government Arts College in the town of Kumbakonam.</li>
                    <li>At the beginning of 1907, at the age of 19, with minimal funds and a stomach all too often groaning with hunger, Ramanujan continued on the path he had chosen: total devotion to mathematics</li>
                    <li>He is recognised as one of the greatest mathematicians of his time, but Srinivasa Ramanujan had almost no formal training in math.</li>
                    <li>His mathematical knowledge developed, from main source of inspiration and expertise became "Synopsis of elementary results in pure mathematics" by George S. Carr.</li>
                    <li>Also, he could afford only a small amount of paper, doing most of his work on slate with chalk, transferring a minimal amount of his working and his results to paper.</li>
                    <li>At about the time Ramanujan entered college, he began to record his mathematical discoveries in notebooks.</li>
                    <li>Ramanujan devoted all of his efforts to mathematics and continued to record his discoveries without proofs in notebooks for the next six years.</li>
                    <li>He compiled 3,900 results (mostly identities and equations), before he lost his life at the age of 32. His infinite series for pi was one of his most celebrated findings.</li>
                    <li>In 1919 he returned to Kumbakonam, Madras Presidency, and soon thereafter, in 1920, died at the age of 32.</li>
                    <li>He was the second Indian to be inducted as a Fellow of the Royal Society, which is a Fellowship of some of the world’s most eminent scientists.</li>
                    <li>One of the notebooks, known as the ‘lost notebook’, was discovered in the Trinity College library by mathematician George Andrews in 1976, and was later published as a book.</li>
                    <li>In 1997 "The Ramanujan Journal" was launched to publish work in areas of mathematics influenced by Ramanujan.</li>
                    </ul>

They must be true because, if they were not true, no one would have the imagination to invent them."</p>
